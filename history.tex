\section{History of Traffic Signal Optimization}
\label{history}

Some of the first public research into the optimization of traffic signals was published by Wardrop \cite{Wardrop} and Webster \cite{Webster}. Wardrop determines the Stochastic User Equilibrium essential for network assignment and the prediction of demand. Webster develops static optimization formulas for cycle time.

The optimizations are mostly concerned with optimizing pre-timed signal plans and creating actuated signal controllers
