There are many terms concerning traffic signal optimization. This section attempts to extract the most important terms and give solid descriptions.


\begin{description}
	\item[MOE] Measure Of Effectiveness. Also referred to as the performance index.
	Most often used is the average delay, also common is the time in (traffic) network and number of stops. 
			
	\item[Cycle] The turnaround time for all phases of a traffic signal to complete.
	
	\item[Phase] A phase of a traffic signal corresponds to a particular state. 
	For instance there may be a green phase in the north-south direction for a two-way intersection (which implies red phase in 		the east-west direction).
	More complex intersections may also split the green phase up into a left-turn phase and a right-and-through phase (for left-side driven vehicles).
	
	\item[Split] (Or \textit{cycle}-split) is the green-to-red time ratio split. Usually a higher ratio means more green time.
