Since the first system was installed there has been a continuous program of research and development to provide new facilities to meet the requirements of the traffic manager. This paper describes the work which is currently being undertaken which will effect how SCOOT operates in four key areas: communications, congestion control, bus priority and puffin pedestrian facilities.},

    abstract = {This paper attempts to develop time-series models for forecasting traffic volume in urban arterials. The Box-Jenkins approach is used to estimate the time-series models. A 1-min data set representing traffic volume on five major urban arterials were available to estimate time-series models. The Box-Jenkins auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model of order (0, 1, 1) turned out to be the most adequate model in reproducing all original time series. The developed model is easy to understand and implement. Further, the model is computationally tractable, and only requires the storage of the last forecasted error and current traffic observation.},

    abstract = {&lt;ce:abstract-sec&gt;&lt;ce:simple-para&gt;This paper deals with modelling of traffic networks (TNs) for control purposes. A modular framework based on coloured timed Petri nets (CTPNs) is proposed to model the dynamics of signalized TN systems: places represent link cells and crossing sections, tokens are vehicles and token colours represent the routing of the corresponding vehicle. In addition, ordinary timed Petri nets model the signal timing plans of the traffic lights controlling the area. The proposed modelling framework is applied to a real intersection located in Bari, Italy. A discrete event simulation of the controlled intersection validates the model and tests the signal timing plan obtained by an optimization strategy presented in the related literature.&lt;/ce:simple-para&gt;&lt;/ce:abstract-sec&gt;},
