\begin{abstract}

Road traffic is an essential part of modern society and has put a high
demand on road networks. Traffic network congestion causes delays
which adds substantial costs to the society and businesses on a daily
basis and also increases emissions and the risk of accidents.

One way to alleviate congestion is to improve the network performance
is to make better use of the existing roads, which can be done by
proper setting of traffic signal parameters.

Traffic signals are employed in urban areas in order to control
traffic flows and avoid collisions by fairly distributing the
right-of-way for adjoining road segments and to ensure a smooth flow
of traffic.


The literature has many suggestions for the intelligent setting of
traffic signals, ranging from purely statistically based methods
developed in the early 60's over actuated traffic signals to highly
adaptive and cooperative methods, which can be realized using actual
flow information supplied by traffic detectors. This paper gives a
survey of the literature with special emphasis on adaptive methods,
which attempts to coordinate traffic signals in larger networks so as
to optimize some network-wide performance index such as number of
stops or delay.

The objective of this survey is to cover the research in the area of
adaptive traffic control with emphasis on the applied optimization
methods.
