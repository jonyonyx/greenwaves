\label{adaptive_cooperation}
Adaptive traffic control systems aims to coordinate signal controlled intersections so as to optimize some performance index eg. average delay or number of stops (or a combination) but also to reduce the need for constant supervision and tuning of intersections.

They do this by dynamically adjusting cycle times, phase sequences and green splits according to detected as well as predicted traffic and thereby reacting to those dynamic aspects of traffic, which cannot be captured by the static optimization routines used to generate time-of-day plans. Some authors (\cite{1}, \cite{44}, \cite{46}, \cite{scoot2004}) even skip or work around the conventional periodic scheme based on a common cycle time and make direct assignments of phases and allow phases to be skipped, in the spirit of the dynamic model presented in section \ref{dynamicmodel}. 

It is evident that the cycle time is crucial in optimization because, for a congested network, increasing the cycle time will always cause a througput increase (there are always cars waiting to cross the intersection). In the litterature the cycle time is often common to all intersections under traffic control so that green waves (arterial progression) can be produced. For direct assignment systems the throughput is dependent on allocation to phases of consecute green time. Long cycle times lead to long phase durations, which allow a steady flow of vehicles to pass and minimizes lost and interphase time per time unit.

For large networks the enforcement of a common cycle is inappropriate, however. Consider a network which is so large that two disjoint arterials exist. In this case it is unlikely that a common cycle time will allow green waves to exist for both arterials eg. when the intersections of one arterial are more tightly spaced than in the other.

(Even though the arterials cannot be considered as a single arterial, they are not completely disjoint due to the effects of chaos theory. Otherwise it would make no sense to control the intersections in the area as  a single network.)

Another feature of considering very large networks is the possibility of traffic redirection. If it is detected - or predicted - that an arterial is, or will be, congested under current flow conditions it is sensible to redirect some traffic onto alternative routes. 
Redirecting traffic using traffic signals is a subtle technique which has not received much research yet though it could pose much more efficient than current traffic information systems, which inform road users of congestions and alternative routes, but allows them to ignore the advice.

In this section some in-depth discussions are given for three adaptive systems, which do not rely on offline optimization. The systems are:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{RHODES} by Pitu Mirchandani and Larry Head presented in \cite{44} - a hierarchical system for network-wide optimization
\item A \textbf{Phase-by-Phase} optimization strategy by Michael Shenoda and Randy Machemehl presented in \cite{1} - a system using the metaheuristic tabu search for determining greens for isolated intersections in a phase-by-phase manner
\item \textbf{DOGS} by danish Technical Traffic Solution (TTS) evaluated in the danish article \cite{dogs}, which provides criteria-based capacity increases along an arterial
\end{enumerate}

Comparisons will be made for the systems to highlight differences in areas such as \textit{detection}, \textit{prediction}, \textit{optimization strategy} and \textit{level of responsiveness}.
