\section*{Abstract}
The signal controllers of heavy-traffic arteries are subject to optimization to best accomodate the movement of the large traffic volumes.
The DOGS system for arterial optimization was tested in the Vissim microsimulator for a section of the Danish ringroad 3. Tests show that DOGS, while providing improved conditions for arterial traffic, can be further improved by selecting an offset for each DOGS level, rather than remaining at the same offset regardless of the currently selected cycle time. For finding such offsets for the comparison a simulated annealing algorithm was implemented to solve the coordination problem ie. finding offsets.
