    abstract = {The SCOOT urban traffic control system is now operating in over 200 cities and towns worldwide. Since the first system was installed there has been a continuous program of research and development to provide new facilities to meet the requirements of the traffic manager. This paper describes the work which is currently being undertaken which will effect how SCOOT operates in four key areas: communications, congestion control, bus priority and puffin pedestrian facilities.},
