##
# This file can enumerate the possible routes between
# a list of links and generate Vissim output. Useful for 
# generating relative flows.

# facts:
# - connectors always connect two links denoted the from- and to link
# - in a non-trivial network links are always connected to at least 1 connector
# - there exist a route from A to C if there exist a connector from A to B and 
#   from B to C. This can be determined by following the outgoing connectors
#   from A and then B until a connector, which ends in C, is found
