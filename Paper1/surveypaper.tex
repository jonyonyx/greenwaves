\begin{abstract}
The objective of this survey is to cover the research in the area of
adaptive traffic control with emphasis on the applied optimization
methods.

The problem of optimizing traffic signals can be viewed in various
ways, depending on political, economic and ecological goals. The survey
highlights some important conflicts, which support the notion that
traffic signal optimization is a multi-objective problem, and relates
this to the most common measures of effectiveness.

A distinction can be made between classical systems, which operate
with a common cycle time, and the more flexible, phase-based,
approach, which is shown to be more suitable for adaptive traffic
control. To support this claim three adaptive systems, which use
alternatives to the classical optimization procedures, are described
in detail.
